## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
This SRS for SCearch release 0.1.0 outlines the functional and nonfunctional requirements for the system being built. This document is to be used as a reference for the team members building and testing the system.

### 1.2 Project Scope
The SCearch system allows students to make a more informed decision about the classes and professors they want to take for the upcoming academic term by having the ability to search for classes, view information about professors teaching those classes, write reviews about their experiences in a class, and contact past students who have taken the class from a professor.

## 2. SRS
### 2.1 Product Perspective 
This product will allow students to view class and professor information. Students can search for classes from the web-app and view a list of professors teaching that class. This product will also allow students to view information about the professor, such as overall rating and “tags” from popular review website RateMyProfessor using an API. Students will also be able to contact past students who have taken the class and ask them about their experiences through email attached to reviews. Additionally, students will also be able to post their own reviews about a particular course/professor they took and have their email attached to increase credibility. Overall, the system will take the best features from RateMyProfessor and enhance them with a more streamlined approach to finding and comparing professors, as well as increase credibility by verifying reviews to students.

### 2.2 Classes Data
Students will be able to search and look at information about classes and professors. This includes the list of classes available for the upcoming semester, as well as the professors teaching it and student reviews/ratings, on those professors.

### 2.3 Login Functionality
Students will be able to login and have their information stored. Their profile will hold their username, their first and last name, major, year, email, and classes taken. There will also be a list of each user's friends and a list of every class and who has taken it.

### 2.4 Review Writing Functionality
User will be able to write reviews on an input and save these reviews to their specified professor or class
